Input Hub --> links to line 1 refiner(s) and Line 2 refiner(s)

Line 1 hub --> Inputs from Line 1 machines, outputs to Line 2 machines & final assemblies
Line 2 hub --> Inputs from Line 2 machines, outputs to Line 1 machines & final assemblies

Output hub --> inputs from final assembly machines (can include honeycomb, glass and chemical if you want to make stuff other than parts/elements) - these are separate machines to the production line ones



customer switch links to customer (all lower case) PB
customer pb links to manager switch and databank

manager switch links to manager PB
manager PB links to core, chef switch, linecook1 switch, linecook2 switch, databank, screen switch and screen(physical)

linecook1 switch links to linecook1 PB
linecook1 PB links to databank and all production line machines in line 1

linecook2 switch links to linecook2 PB
linecook2 PB links to databank and all production line machines in line 2

chef switch links to chef PB
chef PB links to databank and final output machines

screen switch links to screen PB
screen PB links to core, databank and screen (physical)

paste the necessary scripts onto the PB's (note chef and linecook PB's are the same script, NO changes needed).

load up ore into input container.
edit the customer scrips to add the required ID's and qty's - examples are included in the script
press the customer button to start the process.

if you are running honeycomb sometimes you'll need to seed the Line hubs as the script can get confused as it has refiners that try to make the h/c, which locks them out from making the base ore required for the system.

I think this covers most of the setup.
